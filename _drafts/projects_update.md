##Game

Rendering is working now just need to organize some things better.

- Actor into entity
- Keep entities data based mostly
- Scale sprites to physics size?
	- Physics objects hava a bounds property that could define width/height
- Map boundaries / walls and dynamic sized objects need tiling sprites
- Entities use an options object instead of regular args
-  

##FreecodeCamp
Need to get back on track and finish up back end development certification. I've finished all the api project a few months back and then took a break. I'll need to brush up on my express/passport knowledge though. [Things can get pretty hairy when you go the DIY route](). I have a feeling there are preconfigured frameworks/templates available though that handle alot of the user authentication/authorization setup for you.

These are the apps I need to build

- [ ] [Voting app](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-voting-app)
- [ ] [Nightlife coordination app](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-nightlife-coordination-app)
- [ ] [Chart stock market](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/chart-the-stock-market)
- [ ] [Manage a book trading club](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/manage-a-book-trading-club)
- [ ] [Build a pinterest clone](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-pinterest-clone)

##Knitting App

Where does this stand right now? Basics working. Need icons and maybe a better app like frame work? Might just be a waste of time though. Basics of changin tile colors was down as well as the general touch controls for panning and zoooming i think. Maybe a second canvas for rendering icons.
