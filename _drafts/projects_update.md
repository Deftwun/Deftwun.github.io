##Game

Rendering is working now just need to organize some things better.

- Actor into entity
- Keep entities data based mostly
- Scale sprites to physics size?
	- Physics objects hava a bounds property that could define width/height
- Map boundaries / walls and dynamic sized objects need tiling sprites
- Entities use an options object instead of regular args
-  

##FreecodeCamp
Need to get back to freecodecamp projects

- Voting app
- Express authorization/authentication

##Knitting App

Where does this stand right now? Basics working. Need icons and maybe a better app like frame work? Might just be a waste of time though. Basics of changin tile colors was down as well as the general touch controls for panning and zoooming i think. Maybe a second canvas for rendering icons.
